# Andrea Vannetti FSJS Techdegree
# Project 10 - Full Stack App with React and a REST API

## Description

In this project I used React to create a client for my existing database REST API (FSJS Techdegree Project 9).
This application provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course or creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the user can create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.

I used React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

## Getting Started

To get up and running with this project, run the following commands from the root of the folder that contains this README file.

First navigate to 'api' folder.
```
cd api
```

Install the project's dependencies using `npm`.
```
npm install
```

If you want, you can cancel the database (fsjstd-restapi.db) and seed it again, to be sure that the database is the default one.
```
npm run seed
```

Start the API application.
```
npm start
```

Open new terminal and navigate to 'client' folder.

Install the project's dependencies using `npm`.
```
npm install
```

And lastly, start the application.
```
npm start
```

The app should start automatically in your browser. If not, browse to the URL [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
